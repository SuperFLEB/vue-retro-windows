		The history of the computer graphical user interface (GUI) began in the 1960s with early research at Xerox
		PARC. Engineers and researchers sought ways to improve human-computer interaction beyond text-based
		command-line interfaces. They experimented with graphical elements like windows, icons, and menus to create
		a more intuitive experience for users. These early concepts laid the foundation for the modern GUI.

		In the 1970s, Xerox developed the Alto computer, one of the first machines to feature a GUI. The Alto was
		not commercially available, but it demonstrated the potential of graphical interfaces. It included a
		mouse-driven interface with overlapping windows, which would later influence mainstream computing. Despite
		its innovation, the Alto remained mostly within research circles.

		The 1980s saw the commercial introduction of GUIs with the launch of the Apple Lisa in 1983. The Lisa was
		expensive and did not achieve widespread success, but it introduced a GUI that closely resembled what users
		recognize today. Apple refined the concept with the Macintosh in 1984, which brought the GUI to a broader
		audience. The Macintosh popularized elements like the desktop metaphor and drag-and-drop interaction.

		Meanwhile, Microsoft developed Windows as a graphical layer for MS-DOS. Windows 1.0 was released in 1985,
		but it was not until Windows 3.0 in 1990 that Microsoft’s GUI became widely adopted. Windows' success was
		driven by its compatibility with existing software and hardware, making it a dominant force in the industry.
		The introduction of Windows 95 in 1995 further cemented Microsoft’s position in the GUI market.

		Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, GUIs evolved with advancements in hardware and design. Operating systems
		like macOS, Windows, and Linux distributions introduced improved graphical effects, touch-based
		interactions, and streamlined interfaces. Mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, brought GUI
		principles to smartphones and tablets, further expanding the reach of graphical interfaces.
	</p>

	<p>
		Today, GUIs continue to evolve with trends like dark mode, minimalist design, and adaptive interfaces.
		Modern computing emphasizes user experience, with GUIs tailored for different devices and accessibility
		needs. As technology advances, new forms of graphical interfaces, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual
		reality (VR), are shaping the future of human-computer interaction.
