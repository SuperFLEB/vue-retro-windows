# @superfleb/retrowin

A Web "Window environment" with 80s-90s retro flavor.

## Status: Very rough. Very WIP.

This is still in very early development, as is this README. I'm just putting something basic here so there's a readme. 

Come back later to see more.

## License

I'm planning to put this on some sort of open source license, but I haven't yet.

Some components (fonts, mostly) are licensed under their own terms. Consult license documentation in individual directories for details.
